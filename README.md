# FastledAccessPOInt

copied together from 2 other projects, mainly the offline poi by circuscientist.com and a fastled webserver by Gyro Gearloose (J. Bruegl)
simple sketch for now, 1 poi, acts as an access point, tested with wemos d1 mini, all info needed as comments inside the sketch.
added Fire2012, stores image data in progmem for now.


ssid = ESP_FastLED_Access_Point

password = ilikerustyspoons

URL = http://192.168.4.1

will try to extend this to a second poi and add more functionality, read images from a filesystem, WebSockets maybe. 
works on my box.
